# Is my color your color?

A single-page website to determine your personal color boundaries across the entire color spectrum.

## About

This project is inspired by and expanded from the original [Blue-Green Color Boundary Test](https://github.com/patrickmineault/ismyblue) called [ismyblue](https://ismy.blue) created by [Patrick Mineault](https://neuroai.science/). The original concept has been extended to cover all color boundaries, providing a comprehensive color perception test.

Uses a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to determine thresholds and compares results against a database.
